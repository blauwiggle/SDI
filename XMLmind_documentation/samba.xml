    <title>Creating a Network Share</title>

    <para>First we needed to install samba itself. This was accomplished by
    the following commands:</para>

    <para><screen><code>apt-get update</code>
apt-get install samba</screen>Then we had to set a password for our user in
    Samba with the following command:</para>

    <para><screen><code>smbpasswd </code>-a &lt;user_name&gt;</screen>In our
    case we used the user root:</para>

    <para><screen>smbpasswd -a root</screen>After running the command a prompt
    showed up which let us enter the desired password which in our case is
    sdi8bsamba because we set it up on our b machine.</para>

    <para>The next step was creating a shared directory. We decided to share
    the directory /usr/share/samba.</para>

    <para>We created a backup config of the original config file in order to
    be able to restore it in case anything goes wrong:</para>

    <para><screen>cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /root/</screen>Then we edited the
    config file and added the following code:</para>

    <para><screen>nano /etc/samba/smb.conf</screen><screen>[sambashare]
path = /root/sambashare
valid users = root
read only = no</screen>A restart of the service is required to make changes
    take effect:</para>

    <para><screen>service smbd restart</screen>Then we checked the validity of
    our config syntax with the following command:</para>

    <para><screen>testparm</screen>Output:</para>

    <para><screen>Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf
rlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)

    <para>We first installed smbclient:</para>

    <screen>apt-get install smbclient</screen>

    <para>Then we listed our shares by using smbclient:</para>

    <para>After that we created the file test.txt with a simple message to see

    <title>Mounting share from a remote client</title>

    <para>We could remotely mount our share with the following command:</para>

    <para><screen>sudo mount -t cifs //sdi8b.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/root/sambashare /mnt/test -ouser=root</screen>This
    command responded with a password prompt in which we had to insert the
    samba password.</para>

    <para>We could then check the content of the mounted share:</para>

cat /mnt/test/test.txt
